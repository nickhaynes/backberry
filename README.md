# BackBerry

When finished, this will be a simple e-commerce demo project meant solely for the purposes of showing skill and readiness for an apprenticeship or employment.  The site will feature a home page with a JS feature to automatically render products, a login/signup page, a payment API, and potential extra features as I see fit.

### What Would BackBerry Be?

BackBerry would be a home for retro BlackBerry devices, as retro BlackBerry phones (in my opinion) represents my favorite iteration of a great smartphone.

#### Image Assets and Attribution

This is not meant to be an actual e-commerce site.  I do not own, nor do I intend to sell, these products.  Images were procured from Wikipedia, and at times, the language of Wikipedia was used.  As I said above, this is not intended to be anything more than a demonstration of my front-end programming skills.  As such, copyright infringement is not intended in any way, and images were only used (and edited to remove background) as a quick way to provide a product idea.
