# BackBerry

When finished, this will be a simple e-commerce demo project meant solely for the purposes of showing skill and readiness for an apprenticeship or employment.  The site will feature a home page with a JS feature to automatically render products, a login/signup page, a payment API, and potential extra features as I see fit.

### What Would BackBerry Be?

BackBerry would be a home for retro BlackBerry devices, as retro BlackBerry phones (in my opinion) represents my favorite iteration of a great smartphone.
